# springboot-springcloud-stream-consumer
We use Spring cloud stream so that instead of just using kafka we can also use other library like rabbitMQ etc.

it is the consumer appliccation. TO use this project we also need producer, so for producer we have a project -
"https://github.com/coderboi88/springboot-springcloud-stream-publisher". we need to clone this project also.
